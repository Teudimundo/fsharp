This is the F# compiler, core library and core tools (open source edition). It uses the Apache 2.0 license.

The "master" branch is for the latest version of F# (currently F# 3.0)

The "2.0" branch is for F# 2.0.

To bootstrap the compiler, binaries built from an earlier version of this project are used.

======= REQUIREMENTS =======

Requires mono 2.9 or higher.

======= BUILDING =======

To build, run ./autogen.sh, then make in the usual way.

To build the experimental FSharp.Core.dll for MonoAndroid or MonoTouch, use
   make do-2-1

======= NOTES =======

Uses bootstrapping libraries, tools and f# compiler. The lib/bootstrap/X.0 directories contain
mono-built libraries, compiler and tools that can be used to bootstrap a build. You can also supply
your own via the --with-bootstrap option.

F# original powerpack sources are available from http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/
